**ImmaduS/ImmaduS**  

The project submission due date ( Thursday at 9AM) 
Expectations: not only complete project, understand concepts to elborate on it, explain various concepts & scenarios. provide documentation which outlines step-by-step instructions ( provide pre-requisites, step by step instructions) in the Readme file   
provide a link to your git repository, Complete 1,2,4 & 5  by Thursday Submission

1-Deploy a Dockerize application to an AWS EKS cluster using a CI/CD approach with GitOps methodology.
Objective: This means automating the entire deployment process, including building and pushing Docker images, updating Kubernetes manifests, and ensuring the application runs reliably on the EKS cluster.
Key Components: Dockerized App, EKS Cluster, CI/CD, ECR, Git Repo - GitOps, ArgoCD, Deployment Manifest, Automation Scripts
- I would like you to use ArgoCD as a GitOps Tool
- you can dockerize any application of your choosing, you dont have to build app from scratch.. the objective is to deploy the app 

2-Automated Incident Response Playbooks:
Objective: Develop Bash scripts for incident response automation, such as malware detection, quarantine, and evidence gathering on Linux systems.
Key Features: Scripted responses to common security incidents, log analysis, and integration with SIEM systems.
Challenges: Creating efficient and effective response scripts, minimizing false positives, and ensuring data integrity.

4-Multi-Region High Availability Infrastructure:
Objective: Design and implement a highly available, multi-region infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.
Key Components: VPC peering, Route 53, Auto Scaling Groups, RDS Multi-AZ, and S3 replication.
Challenges: Ensuring seamless failover between regions, minimizing latency, and maintaining consistency across regions.

5-Self-Healing Infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code:
Objective: Create a self-healing infrastructure using Terraform and custom scripts that can detect and remediate issues automatically.
Key Components: Custom health checks, Lambda functions, CloudWatch Events, and SSM Automation documents for remediation.
Challenges: Developing robust and automated self-healing processes that minimize human intervention in incident resolution.



Concept Objectives you should be able to answer, meaning i expect you to deep dive in EKS, GitOps/ArgoCD, CI/CD , Docker/Kubernetes , High Availability, Terraform , AWS services you are using 
 Understanding how Docker handles networking, including bridge networks, overlay networks, and host networking
whats failover between regions?, how do you minimize latency?
Explain the difference between bridge and overlay networks in Docker?
How does Docker Compose help in managing multi-container applications, and what are its key components?
Describe how you would design an EKS cluster for high availability and fault tolerance.
What are some best practices for securing Docker containers in a production environment?
Explain the sidecar pattern in container orchestration. How does it improve application scalability and reliability?
How would you integrate EKS with CI/CD pipelines for deploying containerized applications?
 Explain the architecture of Amazon EKS and its key components.
How can you scale worker nodes in an EKS cluster, and what is the significance of node groups?
What is GitOps, and how does ArgoCD fit into the GitOps methodology?
Explain the key components of ArgoCD. How do they interact with each other?
What are the benefits of using ArgoCD over traditional deployment methods in Kubernetes?
Describe the process of setting up ArgoCD for a new Kubernetes cluster. What are the prerequisites and necessary configurations?
How does ArgoCD handle synchronization between the desired state in Git and the actual state in a Kubernetes cluster?
What is the role of the ArgoCD Application CRD (Custom Resource Definition) in defining and managing applications?
Explain the concept of ArgoCD Rollouts. How can they be used for blue-green or canary deployments?
